## About

This is the unofficial Wails Sveltekit (Static) template.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## included two frontend directories;

 frontend.demo - the sveltekit demo
    - With a static adapter, server side rendering is
  disabled and the app is served as a static site.
  This breaks the wordle clone in the demo, as the
  javascript is not executed on any server.

    - Note: Havent tinkered with getting it to work,
  which I suspect is really just a matter of passing
  the work off to golang instead.

 frontend.skeleton - an empty app frontend
    - This results in a pretty straightforward addition
  of many useful features of sveltekit such as routing,
  to wails svelte. It 

 Both are configured not to do server side rendering; they
 build the site into the frontend/build directory which is
 embedded into the application during 'wails build'.

 'wails dev' should properly launch vite to serve the site
 for live development without needing to seperately launch
 'npm run dev' or your flavor such as pnpm in the frontend
 directory seperately.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
